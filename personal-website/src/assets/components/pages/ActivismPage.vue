    <p>Politics is something I always tried to steer clear from. It tends to polarize people even about issues that don’t seem particularly polarizing on their faces. However, party affiliation and support or detraction from a particular candidate or politician has become a part of many people’s identities, and attacks on a politician or political party viewed as personal attacks on a person who identifies with the same.</p>
    <p>I served on active duty with the United States Air Force from 2007-2018. I was medically retired due to a disability I incurred while serving in Afghanistan. Now in some ways, being retired from the military has “freed” me to publicly state a position on political matters, whereas before I took seriously the duty of government employees to maintain neutrality and not to endorse a particular candidate or political party, but instead to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America and to obey the orders of higher ranking commissioned officers and our civilian chain-of-command, to include the US President as commander-in-chief.</p>
    <p>That having been said, the purpose of this post is not to advocate for or against a particular candidate, elected official, or political party. Rather, I wanted to share my experience of becoming an activist for a particular cause, and in some ways the exercise in frustration that has been.</p>
    <p>The political cause I chose to become involved with is one that is near and dear to my heart, and affects me personally: the 1891 prohibition on military retirees receiving both their earned military pensions through their branch of service (in my case, the US Air Force) and disability compensation through the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
    <p>
      I started a

      >Petition on Change.org</a> advocating for Congress to correct this injustice. It is worth noting that the unjust prohibition on receiving both a military pension (available only to military retirees who meet specific criteria such as lengthy service or incapacitation for performance of military duties as a result of a service-connected disability) and Veterans Affairs disability benefits (available to any veteran who served 90 days or more, including at least 1 day during a period of war, to include 2 August 1990 – Present) was partially corrected by legal changes in 2003 and subsequent years. However, that “fix” was and is partial, and leaves out a significant population of deserving, and yes, needy, disabled military retirees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the current law, 10 USC § 1414, military retirees who are eligible for both a military pension (retired pay) and who are rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs as being at least 50% disabled may receive both their earned military pension and their VA disability compensation. However, military retirees rated as 40% or less disabled are denied “concurrent receipt” of both their pension and the VA disability compensation they otherwise qualify for. They have to sacrifice either all or a portion of their military pension, or forego receiving VA disability compensation. This seems more than a little unfair when one considers that an individual who served 90 days, not even finishing a single enlistment, may receive lifetime VA disability compensation, yet a 20 or 30 year military retiree and pensioner with a 40% disability rating
      <em>may not</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s another class of military retirees who likewise are left out in the cold: those involuntarily retired due to incapacitating disability. Under service regulations, the military can forcibly retire military members if,
      <em>in connection with their military service</em>, they have become so incapacitated they are no longer capable of performing military duties. I am one such involuntary military retiree, having served 10 years, 11 months on active duty. I have friends who have served 13 or even 18 years and been involuntarily retired due to service-connected disabilities. We’re not allowed to receive both our military pensions and VA disability compensation, even though in my own case and that of several others I know, we are rated as 100% disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs–in other words, the VA has assessed us as having no reasonable capability of working full time (at least in a way that’s sustainable to our health). Moreover, our military pensions are far lower than they would have been had we not become disabled through our military service–military pensions are calculated based on the average of the highest 36 months of military basic pay. This increases exponentially the more years of service one has, and with each subsequent promotion. Thus, our pensions are far less than they would otherwise have been, and we’re denied “concurrent receipt” of both our military pensions and the VA disability compensation we’re otherwise eligible for. That’s a double financial hit for disabled veterans/military retirees who sacrificed our health and future employability in service of our nation.

      So, what did I do about it? For starters, I created a

        target='_blank'
      >Petition on Change.org</a>. I also wrote to the Representatives and Senators on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees charged with reviewing and suggesting changes to the law as it regards Military Personnel, to include retirement benefits.
    </p>
    <p>There are 14 Representatives on the House Armed Services Committee and 7 Senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee who have the most power to change this law, and I wrote to each of them in addition to my local Representative and Senators.</p>

    <p>So what has this brief foray into political activism taught me? For starters, it’s a lot harder than it seems! After sharing my Petition on Twitter and Facebook, I immediately experienced a surge of support and re-shares. As of 8 June 2018 the Petition was at 245 signatures. The Petition stalled out for a while, then surged to over 51,000 signatures as of 14 February 2019. As of 20 May 2020, the Petition stands at just over 52,000 signatures. Momentum has stalled once again.</p>
    <p>Part of the problem is that veterans lobbying organizations seem to have focused in recent years on the larger group of veterans who have a 40% or lower disability rating, and seeking to eliminate the ban on dual compensation for them. That is all well and good, but by definition those veterans are able to find meaningful work. There are also a lot of them, and discussions with Congressional Representatives inevitably led to the issue of cost.</p>

      >crunched the numbers</a> in order to show that there is an easy way to provide meaningful relief to the veterans who most need it, without blowing up the federal budget. However, since there are so few of us, perhaps veterans lobbying groups do not think we are worth the time to lobby for--they would rather focus their efforts on the much larger group of constituants who Congress has repeatedly said would cost too much to allow dual compensation.

      Another topic near and dear to my heart is how I got my disability in the first place, the current theory being that

      >toxic exposures caused neurological and immune dysfunction</a> in me and hundreds of thousands of other war veterans who deployed to the Middle East or Southwest Asia in support of US military operations. While there is a growing consensus about our government inadvertently poisoning its own Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Airmen during the Persian Gulf War, not much attention has been given to the plight of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans, even though our symptoms are virtually the same as Persian Gulf War veterans (so much so that I was told by a specialist I matched 1 of 2 distinct subgroups of Gulf War Illness veterans that he had identified in a
      <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3683000/' target='_blank'>previous study</a>).
    </p>
    <p>I would sure like to draw attention to the irreparable harm we’re causing to our military service members by exposing them to toxic substances, and demand the government take action to prevent my brothers and sisters in arms from becoming disabled like me in the future, but I feel the medical science (and research funding) has to catch up first, until the case is so cut-and-dry that no one but the greatest of fools would deem to deny what we’re doing while keeping a straight face. I hope that evidence comes soon, because it is sickening to think of others becoming disabled the same way I was through their military service.</p>
