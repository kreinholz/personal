    synopsis: 'Hoffnungslose Ziele III: Sympathy for the Fallen is a fantasy novel and direct sequel to Hoffnungslose Ziele II: Anna’s Crusade, and the final installment in the Hoffnungslose Ziele series. The story begins in the year 1866, in the middle of events that took place in Hoffnungslose Ziele: A Dark Journey of Lost Causes, but it does not stay there. Rather, while centering around 2018, Hoffnungslose Ziele III takes the reader on a journey across time and various realms, exploring in much greater detail than the first two novels the back stories of the more fantastic beings found in the series. In 1867, in the first book of the series, Metia killed the partisan Devil and liberated an imprisoned soul from Hell, something that was supposed to be impossible. In 1891, she did something even more outrageous: she killed the four arch-demons who ruled as Princes of Hell following the Devil’s demise, unraveled the dark barrier surrounding Hell, and reformed the underworld in a more pagan image, opening the path to redemption even to the damned and ending eternal punishment. She also more or less rid the earth of demons, leaving humanity free from supernatural influences. Near the end of the second book, Anna’s Crusade, the reader was introduced to the demigoddess Metia’s daughter, Julia. After coming of age during World War I and witnessing the death of her older brother, Julia, the reincarnation of Fate, has waited not so patiently for her brother to reincarnate. Once she finds him, a mortal man who remembers nothing of his previous incarnation, she cannot resist the temptation to meddle in his life! Julia, flanked by Anna and Metia’s daughters Amy and Luna, born in modern times (the 1970s), conspires to cure their reincarnated brother of his debilitating chronic illness, and jog his past life memories in the process. The results of Julia’s meddling, and the events it sets in motion, are beyond even the Goddess of Fate’s ability to predict. In 2018, as a direct result of Julia’s meddling, Metia’s reincarnated son finds himself lost on a journey across time, a journey that reveals the motives of numerous villains in the previous mythology for doing the things they did. It also leads him directly into the path of the fallen angels, and forces him, and all of Metia’s children, to confront the horrors of Hell anew. It also calls into question everyone’s belief that the “partisans,” or angels and demons, are either purely good or purely evil, and that those who have fallen are truly beyond redemption. Anna and Metia’s children are not just conflicted over whether they can trust any of the fallen, though: a new threat is revealed, a plan hatched by some of the fallen themselves to unravel the home of the angels and corrupt all of Creation. Faced with an impossibly strong enemy, Anna’s and Metia’s family of pagan gods/goddesses must work together, and even team up with a fallen angel they may or may not be able to trust, to escape from Hell and prevent the end of the world. If you were surprised by the plot twists in the first two books, buckle up–you’re in for a wild ride!'
