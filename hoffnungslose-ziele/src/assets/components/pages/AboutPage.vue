    <p>Since I was a teenager, it has always been my dream to write. I’m not talking news articles or law reviews–I’m talking creative writing: novels and/or screenplays. For me, reading and writing creative works is a sanctuary and an escape. Some of my favorite authors include J.R.R. Tolkien, Jules Verne, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Bram Stoker, and Robert Jordan (James Oliver Rigney, Jr).</p>
    <p>I also love film. What directors like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, Tim Burton, and many others do is, in my humble opinion, nothing short of magic. I love watching their visions brought to life on the silver screen.</p>

      I started writing short stories, often in collaboration with friends, as early as 1st Grade. It’s something I’ve enjoyed doing my entire life. In fact, the genesis of my first published novel,
      <span
        class='book-title'
      >Hoffnungslose Ziele</span>, came from a
      <a href='http://nanowrimo.org/' target='_blank'>NaNoWriMo</a> challenge issued by my best friend back in 2014. The short story I wrote had very little to do with
      <span
        class='book-title'
      >Hoffnungslose Ziele</span>, but marked the first time I experimented with the epistolary novel format (albeit exclusively diary entries by a single character). I immediately fell in love with the format.
    </p>
    <p>
      For
      <span class='book-title'>Hoffnungslose Ziele</span>, my first published novel, I took Bram Stoker’s Dracula along with several vivid and recurring dreams as my primary inspiration, and wrote entirely from the perspective of six characters penning diary entries and the occasional letters to each other. It’s a very interesting format, giving the reader a first person perspective, without limiting that perspective to the mind of a single protagonist. I was also deeply interested in Central European (especially Prussian) folklore, which is why
      <span
        class='book-title'
      >Hoffnungslose Ziele</span> dispenses with many of the 20th Century conceptions of such creatures as werewolves and vampires, hearkening back instead to 19th century folklore about these creatures with a healthy dose of my own imagination mixed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I intended for
      <span class='book-title'>Hoffnungslose Ziele</span> to be a standalone novel, and frankly, it can be read as such, but due to the insistence of a few very persistent readers, I decided to dive back in and further explore that world and how the characters deal with the aftermath of their coming of age adventures once they reached middle age. The result is
      <span
        class='book-title'
      >Hoffnungslose Ziele II: Anna's Crusade</span>. In particular, I felt that Anna had a lot of unfinished business and deserved the opportunity to tie up those loose ends.
      <span
        class='book-title'
      >Hoffnungslose Ziele III: Sympathy for the Fallen</span>, may turn some folks off as “a bridge too far.” (In part because I included a fictionalized version of myself as a character who actually drives the plot rather than simply meeting the characters and compiling their journal entries into a cohesive narrative at the end of the book). To that, I would just say that (1) I wrote the book at a pretty hopeless time in my own life, when going on real-life adventures was out of the question, and (2) I liked all of my surviving characters too much to make them walk the path I imposed on my own character. Again, the first book is intended to stand on its own, so going further down the rabbit hole with each sequel is truly optional (although I did have fun writing each book).
