    <p>I’m an Aries, born in Wisconsin but living in California, a husband and father of four, and an attorney (currently inactive) licensed in the State of California, where I currently live with my wife and children.  I’m also a United States Air Force retiree/veteran with service in Afghanistan and the Republic of Korea.  I have a chronic (autoimmune) illness as a result of my military service.</p>
    <p>Since I was a teenager, it has always been my dream to write. I started writing short stories, often in collaboration with friends, as early as 1st Grade. It’s something I’ve enjoyed doing my entire life. In fact, the genesis of my first published novel, <a href='https://www.hoffnungslose-ziele.com' target='_blank'><span class='book-title'>Hoffnungslose Ziele</span></a>, came from a <a href='http://nanowrimo.org/' target='_blank'>NaNoWriMo</a> challenge issued by my best friend back in 2014.</p>
    <p>Personality-wise, I’m an INFP, “the mediator,” according to the Myers-Briggs personality types, although interestingly before my illness I was an ESFP, “the entertainer” (albeit just 1% over the line from Introvert to Extravert, and 1% over the line from Intuition to Sensing, so I carried traits of my present personality even when I was still more outgoing and adventurous), so make of that what you will.  I personally find the INFP label to be a closer fit for me, but occasionally catch glimpses of ESFP still peeking out (mostly when engrossed in conversation).  You can find more info on the Myers-Briggs types and take a personality test yourself <a href='http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality' target='_blank'>here</a> or <a href='https://www.16personalities.com/' target='_blank'>here</a>. I took the <a href='https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/' target='_blank'>Enneagram Test</a> as well after feeling inspired to do so by one of my favorite bloggers, Nikki Albert, and <a href='https://brainlessblogger.net/2018/03/14/get-to-know-the-brainless-blogger/' target='_blank'>her post on getting to know her</a>.  My Enneagram Type is 2, “the helper.”</p>
    <p>For those who can’t get enough of personality tests, I’m an “Empathetic Idealist” according to the <a href='https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/' target='_blank'>Big-5 OCEAN Assessment</a>.</p>
    <p>So that’s a bit about me!</p>
