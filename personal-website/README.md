# Kevin Reinholz (Personal Website)
+ By: Kevin Reinholz
+ Production URL: <https://www.kevinreinholz.com>

## Summary
+ This is a simple Vue.js based application that displays content in a website format.
+ The site is a demonstration of a Vue.js-powered SPA with static deployment to Netlify.
+ I built this app/site using a minimum of Vue.js-related dependencies, and relied on static JSON-formatted data rather than pulling in Vuex since the data displayed on each "page" is essentially static and doesn't need to be reactive. Still, I played around with different ways of interacting with, and displaying, data, and hope this demonstrates how easy it is to create a complete "website" using Vue.js and deploy it to the web.
